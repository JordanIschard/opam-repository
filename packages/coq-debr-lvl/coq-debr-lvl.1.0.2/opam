  "Collection of interfaces and implementations for a modular using of De Bruijn level"
description: """
Formalization of a language often implies variables or equivalent. A specific representation of them is required in order 
    to avoid capture issues. Consequently, we define here a collection of interfaces and implementations for using De Bruijn level.
    In addition to the definition of a level and its minimal set of functions/properties, we propose a modular way to define a
    'leveled' elements and provide numerous predefined data types and data structures such as option, pair, list, map, etc."""
